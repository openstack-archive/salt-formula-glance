If not specified, no quality of service (QoS) is applied on that traffic direction. So, if you want to shape only the network's incoming traffic, use inbound only (and vice versa). The OpenStack Networking service abstracts the physical implementation of the network, allowing plugins to configure and manage physical resources. Virtual Interfaces (VIF) in the logical model are analogous to physical network interface cards (NICs). VIFs are typically owned a managed by an external service; for instance when OpenStack Networking is used for building OpenStack networks, VIFs would be created, owned, and managed in Nova. VIFs are connected to OpenStack Networking networks via ports. A port is analogous to a port on a network switch, and it has an administrative state. When a VIF is attached to a port the OpenStack Networking API creates an attachment object, which specifies the fact that a VIF with a given identifier is plugged into the port.",
